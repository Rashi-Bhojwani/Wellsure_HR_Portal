## P0 — Planning (2026-10-30)

**Git.** Working tree clean at start. `git fetch --all`. Base `origin/feat/hr-payroll-separation` tip `8979072`
("CI: a time limit on every job…"); latest base commits read: `8979072`, `1d3d899`, `c5448d5`, `171aab5`,
`dd236f5`, `4180402`, `828a06b`, `69b4bfb`, `c179e7c`, `829e5dd`. `origin/peeps/foundation` already existed,
equal to `main` (`c787e92`) with no commits of its own; resetting it would need a force-push, so the base was
**merged** into it (`2a4fad1`, clean). Extra content vs the base: `main`'s synthetic `docs/samples/*` and an
encoding-only `frontend/package.json` description line (PEEPS_PLAN §0.2, Q-F3).

**Built.** Nothing in the application. Docs only: `PEEPS_PLAN.md`, `PEEPS_CHECKLIST.md`, this file.

**Found.**
1. The integration guide is not in the repo or attached → section A is per topic, chapter numbers pending (Q0).
2. Super Admins hold every permission key in code → confidentiality "even from directors" must be relationship-gated (PEEPS_PLAN §0.3).
3. 2FA is mandatory for Super Admins in code and in payroll readiness; decision says optional for now → flagged, not mine (Q-X2).
4. Helpdesk queues (H3) designed but not built; split with the other session needed (Q-T1).
5. Placeholder/Confirmed exists only inside payroll → Peeps gets its own small store.
6. `peeps_` migration folders sort after every timestamped one (PEEPS_PLAN §0.8, §C.3).

**Checkpoint run (after merging the base).** Full backend suite run alone on `2a4fad1` against a local Postgres 16 /
Redis 7: **172 files, 1,651 tests, all passed** (about 17 minutes). Frontend checks were not run: this stage changes only
docs, and the merge brought no frontend change except the encoding-only `package.json` description line. Note for later
sessions: start `redis-server` outside the repo root, because the repo tracks a `dump.rdb` that a local Redis overwrites.

**Decided by me.** Merge instead of reset (no force-push); `frontend/src/features/<name>/` created as the
prompt says although existing screens use `pages/`; readings of "leave extension", "Unmute" and "insights"
(listed as questions Q-L1, Q-U1, Q-I1).

**Waiting.** PEEPS_PLAN §F. STOP here until you review.

## P0b — Owner's answers applied (2026-10-30)

**Git.** `git fetch --all`: the base moved `8979072 → 0fade2e` (`2bdaaf2` narrower HR keys: `letters.issue.nopay`,
`invitations.send`, `import.details.manage`; `74c1496` layout author cannot confirm; `0fade2e` bank files
.xlsx/.csv only). Merged into `peeps/foundation` at `0621f82` (clean).

**Integration guide.** The owner said it is in `docs/integration/`. It is **not** on any remote branch: I fetched
all of them and searched every branch's history for `docs/integration/` and for guide-like file names. Most likely
it was committed locally but not pushed. The chapter mapping (plan commit 2) stays blocked; nothing else waits on it.

**Plan changes (docs only).** An answers table at the top of `PEEPS_PLAN.md`; §B.3 rewritten (general desk,
visibility by category, Payroll category is Session A's); §B.4 rewritten (four new leave types, HR prepares /
director approves, HR-only supporting documents checked as HR role plus key because Super Admins hold every key,
Annual Leave = PL, new types left out of year-end until their rule is approved); §B.9 rewritten (Unmute: scheduling
and completion only, participants only, no notes or topic); §B.10 rewritten (four metrics, definitions Not set,
small-group minimum); §B.0.4 (switch keys in a PEEPS block only); HR enters bank/identity details at joining through
the existing writers; relieving/experience letters through `letters.issue.nopay` when pay-free; remote attendance
added to Session A's list; §A, §C, §D, §F, §G updated to match.

**Checkpoint run.** Full backend suite run alone on `0621f82`: **175 files, 1,691 tests, all passed** (about 16 minutes). Docs-only change otherwise; frontend checks not run.

**Decided by me.** (1) Existing helpdesk categories get no visibility row on migration, so today's behaviour holds
until an owner sets one (no preset). (2) The team-calendar label for the new types defaults to a generic "Leave"
until set. (3) Extending an approved leave is dropped (not in the answer).

**Waiting.** The guide push; the first build prompt.
