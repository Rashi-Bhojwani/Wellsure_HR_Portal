## P0 — Planning (2026-10-30)

**Git.** Working tree clean at start. `git fetch --all`. Base `origin/feat/hr-payroll-separation` tip `8979072`
("CI: a time limit on every job…"); latest base commits read: `8979072`, `1d3d899`, `c5448d5`, `171aab5`,
`dd236f5`, `4180402`, `828a06b`, `69b4bfb`, `c179e7c`, `829e5dd`. `origin/peeps/foundation` already existed,
equal to `main` (`c787e92`) with no commits of its own; resetting it would need a force-push, so the base was
**merged** into it (`2a4fad1`, clean). Extra content vs the base: `main`'s synthetic `docs/samples/*` and an
encoding-only `frontend/package.json` description line (PEEPS_PLAN §0.2, Q-F3).

**Built.** Nothing in the application. Docs only: `PEEPS_PLAN.md`, `PEEPS_CHECKLIST.md`, this file.

**Found.**
1. The integration guide is not in the repo or attached → section A is per topic, chapter numbers pending (Q0).
2. Super Admins hold every permission key in code → confidentiality "even from directors" must be relationship-gated (PEEPS_PLAN §0.3).
3. 2FA is mandatory for Super Admins in code and in payroll readiness; decision says optional for now → flagged, not mine (Q-X2).
4. Helpdesk queues (H3) designed but not built; split with the other session needed (Q-T1).
5. Placeholder/Confirmed exists only inside payroll → Peeps gets its own small store.
6. `peeps_` migration folders sort after every timestamped one (PEEPS_PLAN §0.8, §C.3).

**Checkpoint run (after merging the base).** Full backend suite run alone on `2a4fad1` against a local Postgres 16 /
Redis 7: **172 files, 1,651 tests, all passed** (about 17 minutes). Frontend checks were not run: this stage changes only
docs, and the merge brought no frontend change except the encoding-only `package.json` description line. Note for later
sessions: start `redis-server` outside the repo root, because the repo tracks a `dump.rdb` that a local Redis overwrites.

**Decided by me.** Merge instead of reset (no force-push); `frontend/src/features/<name>/` created as the
prompt says although existing screens use `pages/`; readings of "leave extension", "Unmute" and "insights"
(listed as questions Q-L1, Q-U1, Q-I1).

**Waiting.** PEEPS_PLAN §F. STOP here until you review.

---

## P0b — Owner's answers applied (2026-10-30)

**Git.** `git fetch --all`: the base moved `8979072 → 0fade2e` (`2bdaaf2` narrower HR keys: `letters.issue.nopay`,
`invitations.send`, `import.details.manage`; `74c1496` layout author cannot confirm; `0fade2e` bank files
.xlsx/.csv only). Merged into `peeps/foundation` at `0621f82` (clean).

**Integration guide.** The owner said it is in `docs/integration/`. It is **not** on any remote branch: I fetched
all of them and searched every branch's history for `docs/integration/` and for guide-like file names. Most likely
it was committed locally but not pushed. The chapter mapping (plan commit 2) stays blocked; nothing else waits on it.

**Plan changes (docs only).** An answers table at the top of `PEEPS_PLAN.md`; §B.3 rewritten (general desk,
visibility by category, Payroll category is Session A's); §B.4 rewritten (four new leave types, HR prepares /
director approves, HR-only supporting documents checked as HR role plus key because Super Admins hold every key,
Annual Leave = PL, new types left out of year-end until their rule is approved); §B.9 rewritten (Unmute: scheduling
and completion only, participants only, no notes or topic); §B.10 rewritten (four metrics, definitions Not set,
small-group minimum); §B.0.4 (switch keys in a PEEPS block only); HR enters bank/identity details at joining through
the existing writers; relieving/experience letters through `letters.issue.nopay` when pay-free; remote attendance
added to Session A's list; §A, §C, §D, §F, §G updated to match.

**Checkpoint run.** Full backend suite run alone on `0621f82`: **175 files, 1,691 tests, all passed** (about 16 minutes). Docs-only change otherwise; frontend checks not run.

**Decided by me.** (1) Existing helpdesk categories get no visibility row on migration, so today's behaviour holds
until an owner sets one (no preset). (2) The team-calendar label for the new types defaults to a generic "Leave"
until set. (3) Extending an approved leave is dropped (not in the answer).

**Waiting.** The guide push; the first build prompt.

## Module 1 — Assets (2026-10-30)

Plan: `PEEPS_PLAN.md` §B.2 plus the answers table; guide chapter 14 / §12. Built exactly the owner's brief for this stage; no other module started.

### Commits
| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `51de81a` | Backend: schema, migration `peeps_20261031090000_assets`, settings (Placeholder/Confirmed), register, assignment history, tests |
| `3423856` | Merge of `origin/peeps/foundation` (the owner pushed the integration guide there, `ca6e485`) |
| `d7fa323` | Docs only: the guide's 19 chapters mapped in `PEEPS_PLAN.md` §A.1 (the guide arrived on this branch mid-module) |
| `1a244e2` | Screens, `GET /api/assets/lists`, DEMO data, `check:sensitive-ui` / `check:popovers` extended; enum value `TRANSFERRED` → `REASSIGNED` (migration `peeps_20261031100000_assets_reassigned`) |
| `0020130` | Merge of the latest `feat/hr-payroll-separation` (`093de72`), clean |
| (this commit) | This report and the checklist |

### What was built
- **Register.** Stable asset ID `AST-000123` (a sequence number, never reused), name, category, status, serial, model, notes. Edits are allowed and
  logged; a register entry is never deleted (trigger).
- **Settings, Not set until chosen.** Categories, statuses (each says whether an asset in it can be issued) and conditions are append-only versions:
  HR Admin (`assets.settings.manage`) enters a list, a **director who did not enter it** confirms it (service check + database trigger refusing the
  enterer and any non-director). Only confirmed lists are used; until all three are confirmed every write refuses with `ASSETS_NOT_SET_UP` and the
  screens say what is missing. A new version cannot drop a code an asset still uses. Nothing is preloaded; the demo company carries DEMO lists.
- **Actions.** Issue, return, transfer (one transaction: close + open), report lost (ends the assignment, needs a status that cannot be issued),
  record damage (holder keeps it), acknowledge receipt (holder only, once). Each writes an append-only `asset_events` row **and** an `audit_logs` row
  in the same transaction and notifies the holder (bell + `user:{id}` socket; both holders on a transfer). Register screens refresh on a signal-only
  `assets.changed` event to `perm:assets.view`.
- **One open assignment per asset.** Partial unique index `asset_assignments_one_open` + `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the asset row. Assignment rows are
  append-only except closing once and acknowledging once (trigger); `asset_assignments` joins `UPDATABLE_APPEND_ONLY_TABLES` in the database-roles step.
- **Who sees what.** Employee: own assets only (`/api/assets/mine`), acknowledges receipt. HR Executive: register read/manage (`assets.view`,
  `assets.manage`). HR Admin: also prepares settings. Directors: everything, and confirm settings. Managers, plain employees, Developer: 403 on every
  register/settings route. A viewer whose data scope is not ALL sees only assets held by people in scope; others are absent (404) and never named.
- **Lost/damaged: event only.** No amount column anywhere, no deduction, no payroll hook (a request carrying `amount` is refused by the strict schema).
- **Screens** (`frontend/src/features/assets/`, all `lazyPage`): Employee → My Assets; Assets Management → Asset Register (filters, detail drawer
  with assignments and history timeline, action drawers) and Asset Settings (enter/confirm). Design-system components only; checked in light, dark,
  1280 and 390 (screenshots taken locally, not committed). Board: no asset frames → styled by system.

### Tests (all new files in `backend/src/modules/assets/__tests__/`)
- `assets.test.ts` (22): settings gate and maker-checker (service and database), every route × employee / manager / Developer (403) and HR
  Executive / HR Admin / director, unauthenticated 401, employee cannot read or acknowledge another's asset (403/404) and `/mine` never lists it,
  issue/acknowledge/return/transfer/lost/damaged, **twenty concurrent issues → exactly one 200 and nineteen 409**, the index alone refusing a second
  open row with the service bypassed, concurrent transfer + return, **idempotent return** (sequential and two concurrent repeats: one event, no new
  audit row), **audit completeness** (every event kind has exactly one matching audit row with an actor, for a nine-action history), append-only
  triggers, TEAM-scope viewer.
- `assetsDbRoles.test.ts` (4): the app role's privileges on the five asset tables.
- **Mutation checks** (one guard broken at a time, asset tests re-run, files restored from backups):
  M1 index removed → "the database alone refuses a second open assignment" fails; M2 row lock removed → all pass (the index alone holds: by design);
  M3 both removed → also "twenty concurrent issues" fails; M4 idempotent-return branch removed → "return is idempotent" fails; M5 audit write
  removed → "audit log, one for one" fails; M6 scope filter removed → TEAM-scope test fails; M7a same-person check (service) removed → confirm test
  fails; M7b same-person trigger removed → database test fails; M8 director check (service) removed → confirm test fails (after adding a case where
  a non-director who did not enter the version tries; the first run of M8 passed for the wrong reason, which is why that case exists); M9 readiness
  gate removed → "refuses to take an asset" fails; M10 holder notification removed → three action tests fail; M11 assignment trigger removed →
  append-only test fails.
- **Full backend suite, run alone**, after merging the latest base (`093de72`): **178 files, 1,737 tests, all passed** (about 18 minutes).
- Frontend after the merge: lint + design tokens, typecheck, 56 tests, build, `check:bundle` (login 231.8 KB, shell + employee home 331.2 KB,
  shell + admin home 352.3 KB) — all pass.
- Browser checks, locally against the dev stack + demo company (before the final merge): `check:popovers` passes (light/dark × 390/1280, including
  the new asset checks); `check:sensitive-ui` passes — **476 pages, no secret, DEMO banner on every one**, including the new asset assertions.

### CI
- `d7fa323` (backend commit included): every job green except `install-lint-typecheck-test`, which failed one test:
  `payroll/__tests__/payrollGuards.test.ts` — the payroll guard forbids the word `TRANSFERRED` anywhere in `schema.prisma` (it would read as
  "money was sent"); my two asset enums used it. Fixed in `1a244e2` by renaming the stored value to `REASSIGNED` through a follow-up migration
  (no edit to an already-pushed migration; the screens still say "Transferred"). The guard test is Session A's and was not touched.
- `1a244e2`: run cancelled by the next push (same tree plus the merge and docs). `e929962` (everything in this module, merged with the latest base): **CI run 206 green on every job**, including tests, demo company tests, schema drift, sensitive-ui, popovers/latency, docker build, attendance replay and Windows agent.

### Shared files touched (all inside `PEEPS-BEGIN assets … PEEPS-END`)
`backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (back-relation as the last field of `Employee`; models/enums at the end of the file — `prisma format` re-aligned
five lines of `PayrollSetupSignoff`, which I put back by hand), `shared/constants/permissions.ts` (three keys, catalog entries, group "Assets"),
`shared/constants/sensitiveData.ts` (`REVIEWED_NOT_SENSITIVE`), `backend/src/lib/systemRoles.ts` (HR Executive: view+manage; HR Admin: + settings),
`backend/src/lib/dbRoles.ts` (`UPDATABLE_APPEND_ONLY_TABLES` — the one-line array had to be opened into lines to add the block),
`backend/src/lib/__tests__/dbRoles.test.ts` (its pinned list of updatable append-only tables now includes `asset_assignments`),
`backend/src/lib/__tests__/cleanup.ts` (standalone roots, purge-guarded models), `backend/src/app.ts` (import + mount),
`backend/src/modules/managers/__tests__/routeInventory.ts` (17 routes), `backend/scripts/demo/seedDemoCompany.ts` (one call),
`frontend/src/routes/employeeMenu.config.tsx` (My Assets), `frontend/src/routes/adminMenu.config.tsx` (the Phase 8 "Assets Management" placeholder
is filled in by a block at the end of the file, so its original lines stay untouched), `frontend/e2e/sensitive-ui.mjs`, `frontend/e2e/popovers.mjs`.
Migrations: `peeps_20261031090000_assets`, `peeps_20261031100000_assets_reassigned` (new tables only; no table of Session A altered).

### Decided by me
1. Statuses carry an "issuable" flag (the guide's available/assigned/repair/lost/retired are examples, not presets); "assigned" is derived from the
   open assignment, not a status.
2. Lost ends the open assignment; damaged does not (the holder still has it until it is returned).
3. Confirming a setting needs no key: the confirmer must be an active Super Admin and not the enterer (service + trigger). HR Admin prepares.
4. Self routes (`/mine`, acknowledge) are gated by sign-in and SELF scope, not a key, like every other self route; so the Developer gets 200 with
   **their own** (empty) list there, not 403. Every register and settings route is 403 for the Developer.
5. No HR switch for assets yet: the switches table's CHECK constraint lists the allowed capability names, so adding one means altering Session A's
   table — left for Session A (see interface notes).
6. Serial numbers are plain text (not field-encrypted): equipment identifiers, not personal data.

### Interface notes for Session A (payroll) — recovery of lost or damaged assets (not built)
The guide (§12) says: HR proposes a recovery, a director approves, authorised payroll staff process it; approval binds incident, amount and reason;
exactly one payroll/F&F adjustment per recovery; approval is not settlement. Under the owners' decisions HR never enters an amount. Proposed split:
- **What Peeps provides (read-only, no money):** the incident = an `asset_events` row of kind `LOST` or `DAMAGED`: `id` (stable, append-only),
  `assetId`, `assignmentId`, `employeeId` (the holder at the time), `conditionCode`, `statusCode`, `note`, `actorUserId`, `at`. I can add a read
  function `listAssetIncidents({ employeeId?, since? })` in `backend/src/modules/assets/` for Session A to import, plus "does this person hold any
  open assignment" for F&F/exit clearance.
- **What Session A would own (money):** a table such as `payroll_asset_recoveries` with a **unique** foreign key to `asset_events.id` (one recovery
  per incident), amount (exact decimal), reason, proposer, director approval (second-director per the owners' choice), and the reference of the one
  adjustment that consumed it — so a retry can never deduct twice. Changing amount/reason after approval voids it.
- **What Peeps would show back:** for the HR exit checklist only "recovery: none / proposed / approved / settled" — never the amount.
- **HR switch:** if Session A wants "Manage assets" as a director-controlled HR duty, it needs `MANAGE_ASSETS` added to the switches table's
  capability CHECK constraint (Session A's migration) and to `HR_CAPABILITIES` (I can add the list entry in a PEEPS block once the constraint allows it).

### Not done / follow-ups (guide items outside this brief)
A missing or disputed acknowledgement creating an HR task (needs a source in the shared tasks inbox); IMEI/SIM identifiers beyond the serial;
spreadsheet import of assets and current allocations; an Assets tab on the employee profile (`GET /api/assets/employees/:employeeId` exists for it);
the recovery workflow above.

## Scope change D-28 / D-29 and Pair 1 — STOPPED at the framework check (2026-10-30)

**Why I stopped.** The prompt says: add the Founder's Office role and its switches only inside PEEPS blocks, do not change the switch framework,
and "if the framework cannot take them additively, STOP and report". It cannot. Nothing in Pair 1 was built, and Step 0's Assets changes were not
made either, because they depend on the new role (the Founder's Office manages the register). No application code changed in this stage.

### Step 0, part 1: the Assets results (done before this prompt, re-checked)
- Full backend suite run alone after merging `093de72`: **178 files, 1,737 tests, all passed** (recorded in `923a0de`).
- CI run 206 on `e929962`: green on every job (recorded in `923a0de`). `923a0de` itself is docs only.
- The base has moved since (`76b4da2`, `d875811`: Session A's Stage 3.1b/3.2). Not merged in this stage, because nothing was built; the next build stage
  merges it first.

### What the switch framework can and cannot take (facts from the code at `923a0de`, identical to the base)
| Place | What it does | Why a Founder's Office switch does not fit additively |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/src/lib/permissions.ts` `resolveAccess` | Calls `applyCapabilities(…)` **only inside the branch for people holding `HR_ADMIN`/`HR_EXECUTIVE`** | A Founder's Office holder who is not HR never reaches the call, so no switch would ever apply to them. Making it apply means editing the resolver. |
| `backend/src/lib/hrCapabilities.ts` `switchRowsFor` | Returns `[]` (no query) for anyone without an HR role | Same: Founder's Office rows would never be read. |
| `backend/src/lib/hrCapabilities.ts` `capabilityState` / `applyCapabilities` | Role-level rows only count for HR roles; **every** entry of `HR_CAPABILITIES` is applied to **every** HR holder | Adding Founder's Office entries to `HR_CAPABILITIES` (the only additive spot) would make them HR duties too: they would appear on "What HR Can Do" and switching them ON would give HR the Founder's Office keys. |
| `hr_capability_switches` table (Session A's migrations) | CHECK constraints: `subject_key IN ('HR_ADMIN','HR_EXECUTIVE')` for role rows, and a fixed list of capability names | A Founder's Office capability or role row is refused by the database. Changing the constraints alters a table Session A owns. |
| `modules/hrCapabilities/validators.ts`, `service.ts` | `roleCode: z.enum(["HR_ADMIN","HR_EXECUTIVE"])`; holders listed are HR role holders | The API and screen cannot address the Founder's Office. |

### Options for the owners (my recommendation first; nothing chosen)
1. **(Recommended) A Peeps-owned switch store for the Founder's Office, applied through per-person permission overrides.** New append-only
   table `founders_office_switches` in my module (capability, state, effective-from, reason, director, confirming director), a "What the Founder's
   Office can do" screen for directors, and an applier that writes/removes ordinary `user_permission_overrides` (GRANT/REVOKE) for the appointed
   person — which `resolveAccess` already honours. No change to the resolver, the HR framework, its table or its screen. Costs: a future-dated
   switch or appointment needs a small scheduled job to apply it at its time; the overrides are visible on the Roles & Permissions screen (I would
   mark their reason "set by Founder's Office switch" and a test would detect drift); re-appointment moves the overrides from the old person to
   the new one in one transaction.
2. **Session A generalises their framework** (role rows for `FOUNDERS_OFFICE`, a second capability list applied to Founder's Office holders,
   the CHECK constraints and validators widened). Cleanest single mechanism; the work and the files are Session A's.
3. **One additive hook in `resolveAccess`** (a PEEPS block calling a Peeps applier for Founder's Office holders). Small, but it edits the one
   place access is computed, which I listed as "not mine by caution"; needs your explicit permission.
4. **Service-level checks only** (the role holds the Peeps keys; each Peeps service reads the switch table before acting). No shared change, but
   menus, sockets and search would not follow a switch automatically the way they do for HR.

### Proposed Assets changes for D-28 / D-29 (Step 0, to build once the role exists)
| Today (built) | Proposed |
|---|---|
| HR Executive and HR Admin hold `assets.view` + `assets.manage` (role defaults + migration) | Register managed by the **Founder's Office and the directors**: the keys move to the `FOUNDERS_OFFICE` role (switchable per the chosen option); a forward `peeps_` migration removes them from the HR roles (directors keep everything as Super Admins). |
| HR issues to anyone in scope | HR may **only issue to new joiners during onboarding**, behind a director switch (Q-14): new key `assets.onboarding.issue`, accepted only for an employee who is "in onboarding". That state does not exist until the onboarding module; until then "new joiner" is a setting (for example: joined on or after a date window) that is **Not set**, so HR issuing refuses. HR never sees the register. |
| HR Admin prepares setting lists; a director confirms | The Founder's Office (or a director) prepares; a director who did not prepare confirms. |
| Employees see their own assets | Unchanged. |
| Directors see everything (Super Admin holds every key, ALL scope) | Unchanged in code; **add an explicit test**: a director sees every asset, its full history and any employee's assignments, including ones held by HR people and by the Founder's Office person. |
| Audience fixed in code | `peeps.audience.assets` becomes a director-controlled setting (who manages, who may issue at onboarding), per D-29. |

### Owner questions recorded (to build as recommended, each a setting)
Q-14 asset register (Founder's Office + directors manage; HR issues to new joiners at onboarding only, director switch) · Q-15 new leave types not
this round · Q-16 badge/nudge givers: managers, Founder's Office, directors; not HR · Q-17 Founder's Office appointed by the directors, no pay access.

### What I need to continue
A choice among options 1–4 (or another). With option 1, I can build Step 0 and Pair 1 without touching any file outside PEEPS blocks.
With option 2, Pair 1 waits for Session A's framework change.
