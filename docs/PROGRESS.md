## Log

### Initial project structure

- Created the pnpm monorepo: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/biometric-agent`,
  `packages/shared`, `infra/`.
- Created the full module/folder layout for `apps/api` (auth, employees,
  attendance, biometric, leave, engage, documents, admin, payroll, reports,
  notifications, helpdesk, realtime, integrations, jobs, middleware, lib,
  config) and `apps/web` (layouts, routes, employee pages, admin pages,
  auth pages, components, hooks, api client, sockets, theme), each folder
  documented with a short README placeholder.
- Added root tooling config: `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
  `tsconfig.base.json` (+ per-package `tsconfig.json`), ESLint (flat
  config), Prettier, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.env.example`,
  `docker-compose.yml` (postgres, redis, minio, mailpit).
- Added `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` (the product spec) and this file.
- No business logic, database schema, or UI screens yet — structure and
  configuration only, per instruction.

### Switched from a pnpm monorepo to a plain folder structure

- Moved (via `git mv`, history preserved) `apps/api` → `backend`,
  `apps/web` → `frontend`, `apps/biometric-agent` → `biometric-agent`, and
  `packages/shared/src/*` → `shared/*`. Removed the now-empty `apps/` and
  `packages/` folders.
- Removed all pnpm workspace tooling: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the
  monorepo-wide root `eslint.config.mjs`, and the `workspace:*`
  dependency on `@wellsure/shared` from every project. Switched to npm —
  `backend`, `frontend`, `biometric-agent` and `infra` each now have their
  own `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `eslint.config.mjs`.
- `shared/` is now plain TypeScript (no `package.json`/build step of its
  own), imported through the `@shared/*` path alias: `backend/tsconfig.json`
  and `frontend/tsconfig.json` map it via `paths`, `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  mirrors it via `resolve.alias`, and `backend` resolves it at runtime via
  `tsx`. Each of `backend/src/index.ts`, `frontend/src/main.ts` and
  `infra/bin/app.ts` is a placeholder entrypoint (import from `shared/` in
  the first two) that exists so `tsc`/`eslint`/`vite` have real, passing
  input rather than empty folders.
- Rewrote the root `package.json` down to convenience scripts only:
  `install:all`, `dev` (backend + frontend via `concurrently`), `lint`,
  `typecheck`, `test` — each delegating to the relevant project(s) via
  `npm run <script> --prefix <dir>`.
- Added `backend/Dockerfile` — a minimal, intentionally non-production
  image (see its header comment) that builds from the **repo root** so
  `shared/` is included in the build context; proves the container installs
  and starts with the `@shared/*` alias resolving. The full Phase 0
  production image (Chromium, non-root user, four entrypoint modes) is
  still Phase 0 work.
- Updated `README.md`, this file, `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to
  describe the new layout and drop every `apps/`/`packages/`/pnpm
  reference.
- Verified `npm run install:all`, `dev`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and
  `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile .` all succeed against the new
  layout (see the commit for exact output).
- No new features or business logic — structure/tooling only, per
  instruction.

### Added UI reference

- Added `docs/UI_REFERENCE.md`: a written description of greytHR's
  current employee-portal and HR/admin-portal screens (layout, navigation,
  what's on each page), captured so our portal feels familiar to
  employees and HR who already know greytHR. Reference only — our own
  branding, colours and Ant Design components, never greytHR's logos,
  illustrations, quotes or text.
- Linked it from `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` alongside `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.
- No UI built yet — this informs the Phase 0 shell and the full screens
  built in Phase 5 (see spec §12); still waiting on those phases in order.

### Phase 0 — Foundation + application shell

**Backend foundation** (`backend/`) — all built and verified live against
real Postgres/Redis (docker-compose):

- Express app (`src/app.ts`): helmet, cors (env-driven origin), pino-http
  request logging, `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (checks Prisma +
  Redis, returns 503 if either is down), central error handler
  (`src/middleware/errorHandler.ts`, handles `ZodError` → 400, `HttpError`
  → its status, else 500) and a Zod `validate()` middleware factory
  (`src/middleware/validate.ts`) ready for Phase 1 routes.
- `src/config/env.ts`: every env var validated with Zod at boot, fails
  fast (`process.exit(1)`) on invalid config.
- Prisma (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`, Prisma 6.19.3 — deliberately
  not the 7.x line, which mandates driver adapters and a new generator;
  see the note below): connected, no business models yet — `/ready`
  proves connectivity with `SELECT 1`.
- Redis (`src/lib/redis.ts`) — plain client + a `createBullConnection()`
  helper (BullMQ needs `maxRetriesPerRequest: null`).
- Socket.IO (`src/realtime/socket.ts`) with the `@socket.io/redis-adapter`
  — handshake auth is a placeholder until Phase 1 sessions exist.
- BullMQ skeleton (`src/jobs/`): a `system-ping` queue/worker proves the
  queue → worker → Redis path end to end (enqueued and processed live
  during verification).
- One entrypoint, four modes (`src/index.ts` → `src/modes/{api,worker,
  scheduler,migrate}.ts`), each with graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT shutdown —
  all four verified live (api serves `/health`+`/ready`+Socket.IO and
  shuts down cleanly; worker processes a real job and shuts down cleanly;
  scheduler starts/logs/shuts down cleanly; migrate runs
  `prisma migrate deploy` and exits 0).
  **Bug found and fixed:** the Docker `CMD` originally ran `npm run
  start`, but `npm run` does not reliably forward `SIGTERM` to the child
  process it spawns — confirmed live (the child kept running after the
  `npm` parent was killed). `Dockerfile`'s `CMD` now invokes
  `node_modules/.bin/tsx` directly so the Node process is PID 1.

**Frontend foundation + shell** (`frontend/`):

- React Router (config-driven — see below), TanStack Query
  (`QueryClientProvider` in `App.tsx`), an Ant Design theme with
  light/dark tokens and a toggle (`src/theme/`), an API client with
  access/refresh-token interceptor plumbing ready
  (`src/api/client.ts` — no real endpoints to call yet), a Socket.IO
  client wrapper (`src/sockets/SocketProvider.tsx`, opt-in via `enabled`,
  off by default), and a React error boundary
  (`src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`).
- Login page (`src/pages/auth/login/`): Employee Code + password, Forgot
  password link, logo placeholder — UI only, no real auth.
- Employee portal layout (`src/layouts/EmployeeLayout.tsx`) matching
  `docs/UI_REFERENCE.md` §1.0: sidebar (logo, profile block, full menu in
  the listed order, grouped/nested), header (page title, Quick Links,
  notification bell, logout), footer; becomes a `Drawer` under the `md`
  breakpoint.
- HR/Admin portal layout (`src/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx`) matching §2.0:
  app switcher panel, per-app top-bar dropdown menus, breadcrumb, Payroll
  Month selector + employee filter in `AdminFiltersContext`
  (`src/context/`), dismissible help strip component
  (`src/components/common/HelpStrip.tsx`), search/settings/avatar/logout.
  Payroll and Admin Tools apps added per spec §7, with menus built from
  §7.5/§7.8.
- Menu/route config (`src/routes/employeeMenu.config.tsx`,
  `adminMenu.config.tsx`): single source of truth per portal — the route
  tree (`src/routes/router.tsx`) is generated from these, rendering a
  registered `element` or `PlaceholderPage` (with its `phase`) otherwise.
  Every employee menu item and every admin app/menu item exists as a
  route today.
- Real static mock-ups (fake data, no backend calls): Employee Home
  (§1.1), Engage (§1.2), Payslips (§1.3), Leave Balances (§1.4),
  Attendance Info incl. month calendar + status colours + stats cards +
  day detail panel (§1.5); Admin Welcome + Dashboard (4 Recharts charts)
  (§2.1–2.2), Workforce Management Overview (§2.3).
- Reusable components (`src/components/`): `StatCard`,
  `StatusCalendarCell`, `MaskedAmount`, `EmptyState`, `ChartCard`,
  `HelpStrip`, `PlaceholderPage`, `ErrorBoundary`.
- Dev-only role switcher (`src/components/common/DevRoleSwitcher.tsx`,
  gated on `import.meta.env.DEV`): jumps between the employee portal, the
  admin portal, and toggles light/dark — no real login required to
  preview either portal.
- Responsive: sidebar → Drawer, admin top bar wraps, all mock-up pages
  use responsive `Row`/`Col` grids — checked at 1440×900 and 390×844.
- Chart colours use the dataviz skill's validated palette
  (`src/theme/chartPalette.ts`, light/dark categorical + sequential +
  diverging steps, run through `validate_palette.js` before use), not
  arbitrary colours.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): install → lint → typecheck → test in
one job, `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile .` in a second.

**Vite / audit advisory:** upgraded `vite` 5→8 and `@vitejs/plugin-react`
→6 (the latest `@vitejs/plugin-react` already requires Vite 8 as a peer,
so this is just "use current versions," not a forced jump) — `npm audit`
on `frontend` is now clean, resolving the advisory flagged in the
previous session.

**Known follow-ups, not fixed this phase:**
- `npm audit` on `backend` flags a high-severity `deepmerge-ts` issue via
  `prisma`'s `@prisma/config` (dev-only CLI dependency, not
  `@prisma/client`; not yet patched upstream even in `prisma@latest` at
  time of writing). Left as-is rather than downgrading prisma to dodge it
  — dev-tooling-only, no untrusted-input path.
- Ant Design's `List` component is deprecated in favour of a new
  virtualised `Listy` component with a materially different API (not a
  prop-rename). `List` still works and isn't removed until AntD's next
  major, so it's kept for now (used on both Home pages); migrating to
  `Listy` is a small, isolated follow-up whenever convenient.
- The production-hardening items from spec Phase 0 (non-root Docker user,
  Chromium for Puppeteer, multi-stage build) are intentionally deferred —
  `Dockerfile` runs all four entrypoint modes correctly today but isn't
  hardened yet.

**Verification note:** `docker build` was confirmed working end-to-end in
this session (image builds, `@shared/*` resolves inside the container,
the `tsx`-direct `CMD` receives and handles `SIGTERM` correctly) but
repeated attempts in the sandbox this was built in were flaky — this
sandbox's outbound network goes through a local TLS-intercepting proxy
that containers can't reach without workarounds, and `npm install` inside
the container intermittently failed against it (a well-known, documented
limitation of that sandbox, unrelated to this repo). Re-run
`docker build -f backend/Dockerfile .` in a normal environment to
confirm; nothing sandbox-specific is in the committed Dockerfile.

## Open questions

Carried from spec §14 — configurable, not guessed, until answered:

- [ ] Exact biometric device brand/model and whether ADMS push is supported.
- [ ] Exact PL eligibility boundary (credit on completing 3 months vs from
      next month) and pro-rating.
- [ ] Leave encashment formula and its tax treatment (to be confirmed by CA).
- [ ] Bank bulk-transfer file format (from bank).
- [ ] PT/LWF applicability per location's state.
- [ ] Actual headcount and full location list.
- [ ] Company domain name for the portal and whether DNS is on Route 53.
- [ ] Whether the office has a static public IP (needed for device push).
- [ ] AWS account structure (single account, two environments, or separate
      staging/production accounts).
