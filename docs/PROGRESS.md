# Progress

Tracks delivery against the phases in `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` §12. Updated at
the end of every phase (tests green, migrations applied, seed updated,
committed).

## Log

### Initial project structure

- Created the pnpm monorepo: `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `apps/biometric-agent`,
  `packages/shared`, `infra/`.
- Created the full module/folder layout for `apps/api` (auth, employees,
  attendance, biometric, leave, engage, documents, admin, payroll, reports,
  notifications, helpdesk, realtime, integrations, jobs, middleware, lib,
  config) and `apps/web` (layouts, routes, employee pages, admin pages,
  auth pages, components, hooks, api client, sockets, theme), each folder
  documented with a short README placeholder.
- Added root tooling config: `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
  `tsconfig.base.json` (+ per-package `tsconfig.json`), ESLint (flat
  config), Prettier, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.env.example`,
  `docker-compose.yml` (postgres, redis, minio, mailpit).
- Added `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` (the product spec) and this file.
- No business logic, database schema, or UI screens yet — structure and
  configuration only, per instruction.

### Switched from a pnpm monorepo to a plain folder structure

- Moved (via `git mv`, history preserved) `apps/api` → `backend`,
  `apps/web` → `frontend`, `apps/biometric-agent` → `biometric-agent`, and
  `packages/shared/src/*` → `shared/*`. Removed the now-empty `apps/` and
  `packages/` folders.
- Removed all pnpm workspace tooling: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, the
  monorepo-wide root `eslint.config.mjs`, and the `workspace:*`
  dependency on `@wellsure/shared` from every project. Switched to npm —
  `backend`, `frontend`, `biometric-agent` and `infra` each now have their
  own `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `eslint.config.mjs`.
- `shared/` is now plain TypeScript (no `package.json`/build step of its
  own), imported through the `@shared/*` path alias: `backend/tsconfig.json`
  and `frontend/tsconfig.json` map it via `paths`, `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  mirrors it via `resolve.alias`, and `backend` resolves it at runtime via
  `tsx`. Each of `backend/src/index.ts`, `frontend/src/main.ts` and
  `infra/bin/app.ts` is a placeholder entrypoint (import from `shared/` in
  the first two) that exists so `tsc`/`eslint`/`vite` have real, passing
  input rather than empty folders.
- Rewrote the root `package.json` down to convenience scripts only:
  `install:all`, `dev` (backend + frontend via `concurrently`), `lint`,
  `typecheck`, `test` — each delegating to the relevant project(s) via
  `npm run <script> --prefix <dir>`.
- Added `backend/Dockerfile` — a minimal, intentionally non-production
  image (see its header comment) that builds from the **repo root** so
  `shared/` is included in the build context; proves the container installs
  and starts with the `@shared/*` alias resolving. The full Phase 0
  production image (Chromium, non-root user, four entrypoint modes) is
  still Phase 0 work.
- Updated `README.md`, this file, `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to
  describe the new layout and drop every `apps/`/`packages/`/pnpm
  reference.
- Verified `npm run install:all`, `dev`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, and
  `docker build -f backend/Dockerfile .` all succeed against the new
  layout (see the commit for exact output).
- No new features or business logic — structure/tooling only, per
  instruction.

### Added UI reference

- Added `docs/UI_REFERENCE.md`: a written description of greytHR's
  current employee-portal and HR/admin-portal screens (layout, navigation,
  what's on each page), captured so our portal feels familiar to
  employees and HR who already know greytHR. Reference only — our own
  branding, colours and Ant Design components, never greytHR's logos,
  illustrations, quotes or text.
- Linked it from `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` alongside `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.
- No UI built yet — this informs the Phase 0 shell and the full screens
  built in Phase 5 (see spec §12); still waiting on those phases in order.

## Open questions

Carried from spec §14 — configurable, not guessed, until answered:

- [ ] Exact biometric device brand/model and whether ADMS push is supported.
- [ ] Exact PL eligibility boundary (credit on completing 3 months vs from
      next month) and pro-rating.
- [ ] Leave encashment formula and its tax treatment (to be confirmed by CA).
- [ ] Bank bulk-transfer file format (from bank).
- [ ] PT/LWF applicability per location's state.
- [ ] Actual headcount and full location list.
- [ ] Company domain name for the portal and whether DNS is on Route 53.
- [ ] Whether the office has a static public IP (needed for device push).
- [ ] AWS account structure (single account, two environments, or separate
      staging/production accounts).
